Hi all,

Welcome to my website. Often I encounter new models or estimation techniques in the scholarly literature which are potentially useful for me. However, the burden to code that new model can be high: it simply requires time. With this website I hope to lower that burden for  researchers  and  practitioners interested to see whether recent RRM models and methods can be useful for them.

Under the tab |[RRM models & Software](https://github.com/gnova3)| you can find code to estimate:

-   [P-RRM](https://github.com/gnova3/MyFirstRepo/tree/main/p-RRM) 
-   [Î¼RRM](https://github.com/gnova3/MyFirstRepo/tree/main/u-RRM)
-   G-RRM
-   RRM2010
-   RRM2008
-   Latent class models, comprising of RUM and RRM classes

Software code is available for commonly software packages:

-   [PANDAS BIOGEME](http://biogeme.epfl.ch/)
-   [Apollo R](http://www.apollochoicemodelling.com/)
-   PYTHON BIOGEME
-   BISON BIOGEME
-   [MATLAB](http://nl.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)
-   [LatentGOLD CHOICE](http://www.statisticalinnovations.com/)


Under the tab '[More RRM methodology](https://www.advancedrrmmodels.com/more-rrm-methodology)' you can find recently developed RRM methodology, dealing with:

-   [Software for creating robust efficient stated choice experimental designs  (new)](https://www.advancedrrmmodels.com/efficientdesigns)
-   [Profundity of regret](https://www.advancedrrmmodels.com/profundity-of-regret)
-   [Accounting for variation in choice set size in RRM models](https://www.advancedrrmmodels.com/variation-in-choice-set-size)
-   [Robustness of RRM modelling outcomes towards omitted attributes](https://www.advancedrrmmodels.com/robustness-of-rrm-models-1)
